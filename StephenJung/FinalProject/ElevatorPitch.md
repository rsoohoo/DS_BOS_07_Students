# Stephen's Data Science Final Project

### Elevator Pitch
Kaggle is the world’s largest community of data scientists, and they provide a number of introductory, “101”,  
projects for aspiring Data Scientists to tackle. I will be attempting to accomplish the project,   
“Titanic:  Machine Learning from Disaster.” I understand this problem as a supervised, classification exercise. I decided to start with a 101 project as I want to focus on creating a solution both in pandas and R, and compare  
my solution with more optimized solutions of the community. Having the data set available will allow me to focus more on the fundamental theory behind data science, which I would like to learn more about. It is also a good way to get familiarized with the Kaggle community and start building my portfolio. I hope to successfully identify which sorts of passengers were likely to survive the tragedy.
