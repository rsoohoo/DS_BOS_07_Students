1. Find all of the Triple Crown (Award) winners ever in Major League Baseball, with their complete batting stats for the given year. Order the results in descending order first by batting average, then by RBIs, and lastly by home runs.

Fetching table:
SELECT a.playerID, a.awardID, b.yearID, b.HR, (b.H/b.AB), b.RBI, b.HR 
FROM AwardsPlayers a, Batting b 
WHERE a.playerid = b.playerid AND a.awardID = 'Triple Crown' AND a.yearid = b.yearid
ORDER BY a.yearID DESC;



A) By Batting Avg
SELECT a.playerID, a.awardID, b.yearID, b.HR, (b.H/b.AB), b.RBI, b.HR 
FROM AwardsPlayers a, Batting b 
WHERE a.playerid = b.playerid AND a.awardID = 'Triple Crown' AND a.yearid = b.yearid
ORDER BY (b.H/b.AB) DESC;

B) By RBIs
SELECT a.playerID, a.awardID, b.yearID, b.HR, (b.H/b.AB), b.RBI, b.HR 
FROM AwardsPlayers a, Batting b 
WHERE a.playerid = b.playerid AND a.awardID = 'Triple Crown' AND a.yearid = b.yearid
ORDER BY b.RBI DESC;

C) By HRs
SELECT a.playerID, a.awardID, b.yearID, b.HR, (b.H/b.AB), b.RBI, b.HR 
FROM AwardsPlayers a, Batting b 
WHERE a.playerid = b.playerid AND a.awardID = 'Triple Crown' AND a.yearid = b.yearid
ORDER BY b.HR DESC;

2. Calculate the number of MVPs and Triple Crown winners by position ever in major league baseball.

Fetching Table:
SELECT a.playerID, a.awardID, f.yearID, f.POS  
FROM AwardsPlayers a, Fielding f 
WHERE a.playerid = f.playerid AND a.awardID = 'Triple Crown' OR a.awardID = 'MVP';

Query:
SELECT f.POS, COUNT(a.awardID)  
FROM AwardsPlayers a, Fielding f 
WHERE a.playerid = f.playerid AND a.yearID = f.yearID AND a.awardID = 'Triple Crown' 
OR a.awardID = 'MVP' AND a.playerid = f.playerid AND a.yearID = f.yearID
GROUP BY f.POS;


——————————————————————————

3. Calculate the number of MVPs and Triple Crown winners by team ever in major league baseball.

Query:
SELECT f.teamID, COUNT(a.awardID)  
FROM AwardsPlayers a, Fielding f 
WHERE a.playerid = f.playerid AND a.yearID = f.yearID AND a.awardID = 'Triple Crown' 
OR a.awardID = 'MVP' AND a.playerid = f.playerid AND a.yearID = f.yearID
GROUP BY f.teamID;


——————————————————————————

4. Calculate the average batting average, RBIs, and home runs by position ever in major league baseball. Only consider seasons where a player had at least 300 at-bats (AB).


Query:
SELECT f.POS, (sum(b.H)/sum(b.AB)) BatAVG, sum(b.HR), sum(b.RBI)
FROM Batting b, Fielding F
WHERE b.AB >= 300
AND f.playerID = b.playerID
GROUP BY f.POS;

5. Return all player info for all players that won an MVP and a Gold Glove during their careers, along with the number of times they won each.

***************************{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}**********************

Query:
SELECT a1.playerID, a1.awardID, a2.awardID, b.*, f.*
FROM Batting b, Fielding f, awardsPlayers a1 
INNER JOIN awardsPlayers a2 ON a1.awardid = 'Gold Glove'
WHERE a2.awardid = 'MVP'
AND b.playerid = a1.playerID
AND a1.playerID = f.playerID;

^This does everything but give you the number of times they won MVP and Gold Glove, I had trouble with that.

——————————————————————————

6. Calculate the number of world series, division titles, and league championships for all teams.

***************************{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}{}**********************
SELECT teamID, COUNT(DivWin='Y'), COUNT(LgWin='Y'), COUNT(WSWin='Y')
FROM Teams
WHERE DivWin = 'Y' OR LgWin = 'Y' OR WSWin = 'Y'
GROUP BY teamID;


——
Couldn’t figure out CASE WHEN

SELECT teamID, SUM(DivWin), SUM(LgWin), SUM(WSWin)
CASE DivWin
	WHEN = 'Y' THEN 1
    ELSE 0
END CASE

FROM Teams
WHERE DivWin = 'Y' OR LgWin = 'Y' OR WSWin = 'Y'
GROUP BY teamID;

^^^ Produced an error :/

7. Calculate the average salary (as a percentage of yearly average) of all MVPs ever in major league baseball.

Getting the table:
SELECT AVG(s.salary) 
FROM AwardsPlayers a, Salaries s
WHERE a.awardID='MVP' 
AND a.playerID = s.playerID 
AND a.yearid = s.yearID
;
