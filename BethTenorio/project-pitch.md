I am interested in studying the market behavior of bitcoin, a form of digital currency growing in popularity and with the potential to revolutionize how we conduct financial transactions.

Specifically, I would like to identify important predictors of bitcoin price. I have collected daily bitcoin transaction records from the Blockchain Explorer website, bitcoin price and volume data from Coinbase, a popular bitcoin exchange, and bitcoin-related results from Google Trends. In addition, I will gather consumer confidence index, business confidence index and other economic indicators for the same period. I will be analyzing the relationship of different features with bitcoin price and spread using regression analysis and time series analysis.

This project will contribute to our general understanding of bitcoin as an alternative currency, and the potential impact of the Bitcoin blockchain technology.
